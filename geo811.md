Hello, I'm George Kong.
I am from Brooklyn College, their Computer Science program.

I like looking at DIY websites on various things.  I play around with computers tinkering with them since highschool, hardware and software side of things.  I really do like both sides though and I know I would need both.

My genre interests are more than likely: sci-fi and fantasy types.

I am doing an internship a the department of education right now but unfortunately it is not software ended.

But I like both really.
I wanted to try computer engineering really, rather than just software development because I want to try building robots or using it to program and build a 3d printer. 

notes: google-3d printed houses only cost 5k...?
       3d printer for metal using rep rap system less than 2k
