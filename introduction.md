Computer science is a passion since I was very young. My interest in this area is focused on new technologies, development, GNU/Linux, open source software and all about the Google ecosystem.

Usually I don't like having the feeling of being taken "hostage" by the editors of Software. Therefore, I'm constantly looking for free alternatives.
