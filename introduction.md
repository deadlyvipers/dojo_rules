My name is Nicolas the Pretty Good, but you can call Nicolas the Pretty Good. I am a developer stationed in Miami, soon to move to San Francisco to dwelve deeper into the cyber tribe. I have a background in psychology, which leads me to often reflect on the similarities between the mind and programs, brains and computers. I love to create, solve problems, read, learn, humor in general. 

Angular I and II were pretty good. The best disigned aethetically, coffescript and rspec, but the best UX was Regex. This one is pretty good thus far, very different.
