Hello.

My name is k-snides, but you can call me k-snides.

My fave path is all of them. I really like Code School. Learning lots on
the git path. Enjoying the JavaScript one so far. Can't wait to start the 
IOS path.

My deadly skills include:

* Git
* AngularJS
* Bootstrap
* Killing history using git rebase
