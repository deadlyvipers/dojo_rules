Hi everyone my name is Francesco, on GitHub known as Rasen2145, It is my 
pleasure to meet you all!
I am from Italy, aged 22.
Just starting to study coding from scratch.
My dream and goal is to become a software/app developer and work within the 
Startup environment & economy of innovation.
Currently, I am about to graduate in Law in Business.
I speak Italian, English, a fair French and basic German.
I love traveling, I am passionate about African wildlife and nature in general.
I am an activist in the field of entrepreneurship, financial education, wildlife conservation and anti-poaching.
I volunteered for several months in Africa between 2012 and 2014.
I co-created an european brand called 'Intermundi' with my mother to expand our horizons and creativity!

Cheers!

Rasen
