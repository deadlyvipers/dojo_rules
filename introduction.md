Here comes a new challenger!

Hello!

My name is Sara, and I'm new around this dojo. :3

I discovered Code School thanks to the Angular's official website a few years ago, and have been an avid fan ever since. Now, eager to finally achieve the Git Master status, I ended up coming here to complete the last out of the four courses of the path.

The path I've enjoyed the most are both Javascript and Git path, as well as CSS for the latest CSS3 features.
