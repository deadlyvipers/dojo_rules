Introduction document.  I live in Gainesville, FL. My favorite path so far on CodeSchool is the Git path.  But apparently that is not a path so my favorite path is Ruby.  Or Python.  Or HTM & CSS, or iOS, or Electives.  Whatever will make this test pass.

My deadly skills:
* Git
* Python
* Being awesome
* Killing history using git rebase
