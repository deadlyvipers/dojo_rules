Hello Dojo! I am Richard, how are you today?

My favorite code school elective is Git. This is not mentioned in your comments of 'Ruby, JavaScript, HTML & CSS, iOS or Electives', but it is definatly my favorite...

Some of my deadly skills include:

* Git
* JavaScript
* PHP
* MySQL
* Apache
* Linux
* Killing history using git rebase
