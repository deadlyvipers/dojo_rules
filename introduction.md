My name is Neal.  I'm a developer specializing in process and workflow for large development teams.  Since we're looking at adopting github for part of our workflow, I'm running through these training sessions to get a better understanding.

I'm currently really into the electives, but will be looking at HTML + CSS

Deadly Skills:
* javascript
* java
* css
* html
* Killing history using git rebase
