# Introduction

Hi!

My name is Christian and I am a Developer and a Musician. I consider myself as a lifelong learner and I certainly learn something new every day!

I started with HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript.
Last year I started learning about Swift and Git. I'm currently working on an iOS app and some projects using Node JS and MongoDB.

I am learning more about Github because it's a powerful tool for collaboration in Code School's Free Weekend!
