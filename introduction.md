Hi. My name is Peter David Carter and I am primarily a web developer with a particular interest in web robots... SkyNets at dawn, gentlemen...

My favourite Code School path is Ruby, because Ruby is awesome. Also, you can code Selenium stuff with Ruby...

Deady Skills:
<ol>
  <li>Bare-metal C++</li>
  <li>English language ninjutsu</li>
  <li>Shadow Node.js API creation, grade 9</li>
  <li>Rumoured to be close to completing the entirety of Code School</li>
  <li>L33t h4x0r ;)</li>
</ol>

Upon completion of Code School there may or may not be a minor boss battle...
