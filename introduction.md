# Codeschool Mastering Github
## Challenge 1.4

Hi friends, my name is George Dhoore and I'm a new member of codeschool.  This is my first structured online education program and I'm loving almost every minute of it.  My favorite codeschool path so far has been the html/css path, however this latest github part of the git path is really cool.  I think javascript will be my favorite when I get to it, however.

Almost every minute... *cough html email cough*

I'm taking this opportunity to learn a little bit about markdown syntax.  My assumption is that no soul will actually read this, but you never know!

My website is at http://homespaceball.com.  The name is taken from the hilarious [Space Weird Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygrdAvmr-MA) video which itself is a mashup between David Bowie's *(R.I.P)* 1969 [Space Oddity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D67kmFzSh_o) and Randall Monroe's 1000 most common English word's comic - [Upgoer Five](https://xkcd.com/1133/).  I plan on taking what I've learned at codeschool and applying it to my website but it hasn't been an incredibly high priority.

And now I believe I need a list to finish this out.  So lets end on a contrived example of some things I enjoy:
* Learning
* Using what I've learned
* Gaming
* My girlfriend Abby.
