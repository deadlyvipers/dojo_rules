###Introduction to Peter Sichel

I'm an independent Mac developer specializing in networking and communications. My passion has been to teach by example while making complicated technology simpler and more accessible. I've had a long interest in user interface design and computer peripherals. I'm the developer of Phone Amego which lets you use your Mac as a control center for your phones. I got hooked on radios and became a licensed radio amateur at age 12 (now W8PS).

Most recently I've joined RBM Technologies to support visual merchandising using Ruby on Rails.
