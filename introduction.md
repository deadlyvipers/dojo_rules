Hey there everyone, Alex here. I am a developer from Florida who is currently taking class at the University of Florida. Learning GitHub as we speak. It is cool how committing changes in this file to my branch automatically updates the pull request. My favorite codeschool path is probably javascript.

Deadly Skills:
1. Web Design
2. javascript
3. GitHub
4. Application Design
