Hello, my name is Dax and I am in my senior year as an IT student.
I am using code school to help increase my skills as a developer,
and am looking forward to starting a new path. I am currently finishing
the Git Path, but believe that the Javascript path will be my favorite!

Here us a list of my deadly skill:
*JavaScript
*HTML
*CSS
