# Introduction

I am an opinionated tech lead based in Coimbra, Portugal. I am
passionate about the Web, technology and other Hackernews-related
content. I am a FOSS supporter and evangelist.

My favourite code school path is

Deadly skills:

* git
* javascript
* docker
* python
* Killing history using git rebase
