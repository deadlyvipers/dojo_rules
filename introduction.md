Hey, how's it going? My name's John and I write the Sassy style sheets from time to time.

That HTML & CSS path is out of bounds and poppin' off!

Deadly skills:

* Bashing you to death
* Smashing you with my shell (also to death)
* Vaguely pale-oh-god-where-did-he-get-a-hand-grenade
* Alcoholism
* Killing history using git rebase
