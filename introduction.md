GitHub learned with a Chromebook
My favorite path to learn with Chromebook is JavaScript. 
I'd like there to be more classes on how to write vanilla Javascript without frameworks from scratch. 
I'd liked the DevTools course too and would like more insight into how to look at scripts on other sites.
