Git is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed,data integrity,[6] and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.

As with most other distributed revision control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server.[9] Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.
