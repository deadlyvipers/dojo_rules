I'm Aimee.
I'm teaching myself how to do a bunch of git/unix/vi/nano stuff via the command line.

So far, so good.

I am currently following the "Full Stack" path in Code School, which is helping
me to 'level up' in Ruby, Rails and JavaScript.

Favorite so far are the JavaScript courses.

Funny how much these things are starting to converge.
