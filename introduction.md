Hey everyone! :)

I'm mozzribo, I do many things. Right now I'm obviously learning Git, which sparkled from a  genius and got refined by the collective mastery of the geekeshly oriented humankind.

Check out my blog @:

My favorite Code School path is currently Git, as that is the only one I've done so far. The Try Git provided a quiet resourceful overview, Git Real was very in-depth (I will use the slides as manuals for the times to come) and this current course is just making me fit all the pieces in a constructive way. Top notch!

Enjoy the learning process!
