Introduction.

Over the last years I have developed a wide range of client applications using Flash, Flex, AIR etc. 
My background in management includes 5 years working in the media and gambling sectors of the IT market. 
In addition to this I have extensive knowledge of Flash and Flex technologies which give me 8 years of total development experience. 

As someone who always provides high quality of service, I am always trying to be closely involved in different stages of the project to fully understand the business needs of the requirements and provide the best and creative solutions. 
The foundation of my managerial believes lies in my passion for project management and time management. 
In every company I work on I bring fresh ideas and creative way of thinking, also help everybody to get to the peak of their potential.

And BTW, CodeSchool rocks!!! My favorite path is Ruby
