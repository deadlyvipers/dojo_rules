Hello, world.
I like the git track because it is the only one I have followed thus far.
Somehow git is not an acceptable choice.
My favourite Code School path is therefore Electives and iOS.

My deadly skills are:
* C
* C++
* Git
* Scheme
* Lisp
* Clojure
* Erlang
* Ruby
* Python
* Perl
* Bash
* Java
* Smalltalk
* Haskell
* Lat but not least, exaggeration
