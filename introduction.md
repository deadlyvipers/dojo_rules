Hi everyone. So happy to be here with you.

Just to mention, my favorite Code Schoolpath in my intro has to be do right with Ruby. This is a tool I am trying to learn as I believe it could earn me millions of dollars.

So all in all, my favorite skills are the following:
* Ruby
* Javascript
* GitHub
