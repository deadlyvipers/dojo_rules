* Hi I'm Classic. I like poetry. I also like JavaScript, and JQuery. 

* Here's my favorite poem this week: 
=================
* They came to tell your faults to me,
* They named them over one by one;
* I laughed aloud when they were done,
* I knew them all so well before, â€”
* Oh, they were blind, too blind to see
* Your faults had made me love you more.

*--Sara Teasdale
