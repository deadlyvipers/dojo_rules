Hello dojo,

I am a developer looking to grow in my Git/Github skills. Currently, I am
wrapping up the Git Path on Code School and am looking forward to practical 
experience from this course. My favorite Code School Path is the JavaScript 
Path. I am a huband with an almost 2 year old daughter. I love the outdoors 
and am a seasoned percussionist.
