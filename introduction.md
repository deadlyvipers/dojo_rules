I am a beginner in a lot of stuff: Web, Java, Javascript with libraries, Ruby, Rails, Perl, Git, C with C++ and C#, Lua, R, Pascal, etc.
I'm only 14 (15 in January), but I've created a team and we're working about a game!
My favorite CodeSchool path is HTML & CSS, bacause there I started my long programing journey :-)
