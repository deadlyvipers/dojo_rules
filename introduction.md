Introduction
============
Hey, I'm Adrian. You might know me from nowhere at all.

My current favourite Code School path is the Electives.

My deadly skills:

* Git
* Bourne Shell (hey, I'm Old School)
* Perl (yep, Old School)
* Python (not that deadly)
* Ruby (more like a "hard stare.")
* Killing history using git rebase
