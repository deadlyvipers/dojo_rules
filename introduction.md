## Introduction

Hi there, 
My name is Fred and this repo is so I can get them sweet badges from codeschool. My favourite path on Code School is JavaScript by far. So much javascript.

My deadly skills are:

* Javascript
* HTML / CSS
* SQL
* SASS
* Node JS
* GIS mapping
* Killing history using git rebase
