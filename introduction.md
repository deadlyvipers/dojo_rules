This is my Dojo introduction.
+My favourite CodeSchool path is the JavaScript path. I haven't watched CSS or Electives yet, but I plan to start with the CSS as soon as I finish Git.
+
+My deadly skills are:
+* JavaScript
+* HTML/CSS
+* Git
+* Killing history using git rebase
+
+I really hate this exercises, they are very stupid. I did all that it was requested and still something is not right.
