Hey Boston College. Your school is a great school but I choode not to come there because it is too good for me.
Hey Boston UNiversity. Your school isn't that good. But great.
Hey Colgate. What is hilly school. The stairs you guys have are tremedous and tireding. You need lots and lots of elevators
My favorite code school path is ruby
