Hello, my name is Brian. I'm web developer and want to became a git master. Nice to meet you.

I really love the way teached at codeschool, it is very clear and practical. As a result, I feel very interesting to solve the challenge and remember the knowledage. In my opinions, the very useful path I found here is Javascript, Git, Database and Breaking the Ice With Regular Expressions in Electives Path.
