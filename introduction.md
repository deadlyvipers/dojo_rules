Hello codeschool,

I am a developer in *Santa Barbara, California*. I have learned quite a bit from **codeschool**, by this point.

I have enjoyed something in each of the paths, but the one I have learned the most from is probably the Ruby path. That is probably because the codeschool courses wildly beat any other documentation on Ruby, whereas there is reasonable information about JavaScript out there.

That being said, the only problem I have ever had with codeschool is a lack of advanced material. Keep it up, guys!

Cheers,
Alex Zlotnik
