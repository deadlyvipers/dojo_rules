kariuki86 Introduction
======================

Arigato gozaimasu~

Thank you for welcoming me to the dojo.

I am still growing and have yet to fully focus on what I want to use these skills for. At this time I am only beginning to see how much I do not know. But with each new day comes clarity.

The git path has been the most enlightening thus far.

Deadly skills:
*CSS/SCSS
*Javascript
*PHP
*SQL
*Killing history using git rebase
