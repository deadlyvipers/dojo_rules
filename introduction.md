Introduction
============

My name is Attila, but on GitHub I'm known as atifar. Looking forward to picking up a lot of useful knowledge about using GitHub effectively in this course.

My favorite Code School path is Electives.

My deadly skills are:

* Python
* Git
* Django
* Killing history using git rebase
