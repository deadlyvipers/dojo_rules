Not sure how to edit and save in vi anymore, which sucks. I used to be a master of vi, now I haven't had a reason to use it in probably fifteen, sixteen years.

My favorite code school path is Electives. I was actually disappointed in the jQuery path, but I still finished it.

* JavaScript
* SSRS
* TFS Administration
* SharePoint Administration
* jQuery (getting there, anyway)
* Killing history using git rebase
