#Introduction

This is my introduction file to the Deadly Vipers Dojo! My name is Ben and I like to code in Javascript, Ruby, and Python. I like to game under the username JungleSpyder or Kagemesude in my old MMO days.

My favorite Codeschool path so far is Javascript, but I can't wait to dive into the Ruby path as well!
