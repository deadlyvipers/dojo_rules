hello my name is gallop_king and I like rocks. 
That is all

My favorite Code School path is Ruby.

I also like emeralds.
And saphires.
And amethyst.

I like rocks.

My deadly skills include:
*Ruby
*C
*C++
*Java(a little)
*Matlab
*ROS
*GML
*Mining
*Gem appraising
*Dynamiting
*Drilling
*Unearthing Ancient Eldritch Horrors

*..And many, many more!

I will NOT do what you tell me to do, robot man! Fight the powah!

...sigh, I must give in to my oppressor to continue...

*Killing history using git rebase

There. ARE YOU HAPPY NOW MR. ROBOT MAN!
