Hi, my name is Carolyn Tiry. I've used git for some of my programming classes, but I'm excited to learn more about the system and using it with Github.

My favorite path on Code School so far is the JavaScript one, but I have several to try yet so that might change.

Deadly Skills:
* JavaScript
* C#
* HTML
* CSS
* SQL
* Killing history using git rebase
