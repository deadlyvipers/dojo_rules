Introduction to Myself
======================
1. Who am I?
------------
Who am I? Ain't it a good question? I suppose if we had an answer to that, then [William Shakespeare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare) wouldn't have written the [Amleth(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amleth).

2. What's my path?
------------------
Oh, I definitely love all of the CodeSchool paths, but the Ruby one out of all is my favorite.

3. Something to die for
-----------------------
* Ruby Desease
* JavaScripts Syndrome
* ODD (Object Developmet Disorder)
* Killing history using git rebase
