Hello my name is Nash
I come from ad organisation named Webonise Lab.
this is my first pre joining assignment and I am enjoying learning something new.
I hope to learn something new everyday and fix myself up into the technical world
in a smooth easy and correct way.
I am excited to know more about the assignment and the course to take up.
I enjoy learning the code school path Ruby and Java script very much.
Have a great day!!!
