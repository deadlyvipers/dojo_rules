Hi, i'am kevin and i'am new to git and github, i would really
like to learn how to use git and github in an efficent and correct
way.

My favorite codeschool path at the moment is the HTML/CSS and Javascript path.
My deadly skills:
* Javascript
* C#
* SQL
* HTML
* CSS
* Killing history using git rebase
