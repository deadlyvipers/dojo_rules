Make a local clone of your fork of the "dojo_rules" repository. Make sure you don't fork the deadlyvipers version of the repo â€“ clone your fork of it.

Create a new file called introduction.md introducing yourself to the dojo. Make sure this file contains an introduction, then add, commit and push your change to the fork.
