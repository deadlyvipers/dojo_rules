Hi! I'm Alex Pawlowski, and I am learning how to better use Github. Thanks for the free weekend!
My favorite Code School path is the Electives path (of which this course is one :+1:)
Deadly Skills:
* Git
* R
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* Markdown
* Python (learning)
* Killing history using git rebase
