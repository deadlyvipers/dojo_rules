#Introduction

My name is Iv√°n, I'm from Spain and I'm web developer. Now I try to learn and code with Meteor because it's very cool ;-)

My hobbies are football, go to the cinema and my family... my little and crazy son!

I like very much learning by doing with Code School and I have to say that my
favorite Code School path is JavaScript.
