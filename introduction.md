Dojo (道場 dōjō?) is a Japanese term which literally means "place of the way". Initially, dōjōs were adjunct to temples.

I know nothing about it.

But I know some programming languages! I worked as an iOS developer for over 2 years. Web development is also cool. So Ruby, JavaScript, HTML & CSS, and iOS, all of them are my favorite Code School paths. :)
