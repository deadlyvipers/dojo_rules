Hello, this is Beau. I am struggling to understand Git and how to use GitHub. I hope the Code School can help me to become a "GitHub Ninja" and master Git and the command line.

My favorite Code School path was, by far, Ruby. Out of the options listed in this exercise, that's the only path I have completed.
