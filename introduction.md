To bring more transparency and clarity to the processes surrounding the
DMCA, we are rolling out three improvements to the way we process
copyright takedowns:

First, whenever possible, users will have a chance to fix problems
before we take content down.
Second, we will not automatically disable forks in a network based on
the takedown of a parent repository unless the takedown notice
explicitly includes them.
Last but not least, we've published a completely revamped DMCA policy as
well as a pair of how-to guides for takedown and counter notices to make
our process more transparent and easier to understand.
