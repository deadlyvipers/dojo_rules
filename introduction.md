Introduction to satisfy requirement of codeschool course challenge.

So far can't decide between Database and Git as my favorite Paths at Code School. Working them alternately!
Maybe I have to mention only those Paths mentioned in the challenge? HTML & CSS.

Time to list out some skills:
* HTML
* CSS
* PHP
* SQL
* Killing history using git rebase
