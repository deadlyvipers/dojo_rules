I'm a pretty cool Rubyist, moving my way through several resources on software design patterns, and fixing to change the world. I haven't yet ventured down the Ruby path much, but have been getting a lot of merit from the Javascript path in the meantime. If you haven't already, go check that stuff out. Angular.js looks awesome.

## My deadly skills
* Ruby
* Rails
* Documenting
* Git (in progress...)
* Killing history using git rebase
