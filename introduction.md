Hello, my name is Hendra Wijaya Djiono.

I am a software developer from Jakarta, Indonesia.

Now focusing on Android application development.

I am new student in this dojo.

I want to learn as many things as i can to support me as a software developer, but my favorite Code School path is Android. Unfortunately, there are only 2 courses about Android in Code School :( 

Douzo yoroshiku.
