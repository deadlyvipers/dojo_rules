Hi! I'm Christine. I like programming because of the many opportunities it offers to learn something new.


Almost done with Code School's Git Path. Looking forward to get started with iOS track.

I really like the Projects and the walk throughs.

Skills:
* Java
* Angular
* Git
* Killing history using git rebase
