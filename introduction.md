Talk about myself

My name is Kelvin. I'm from Brazil, and my focus on this course is to learn and increase my knowledge about Git and Github to become a better professional as soon as possible. My favorite Code School path is the Ruby, it is an excellent and exciting language, so I intend to invest my time learn it.
