Hello my name is Justin
My favorite codeschool path was the JAVASCRIPT path. I enjoyed the React and node courses the most. I just hope there would be an update to these courses correlating to the new versions of React, NodeJS, or ES6 syntax

Deadly Skills: 
*Javascript
*React
*Node
*Git/Github
*MongoDB
*PUG/SASS
*Killing history using git rebase
