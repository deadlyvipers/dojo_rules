Hello, my name is Dean and I've come a long way from knowing nothing about software development to becoming nearly proficient to be deemed an entry level developer. I still need to round off the rough edges of my skills and hopefully by the end of the year I'll be good enough to produce professional grade work. 

So far on Code School, my favorite learning path is Git. I haven't come across a better video tutorial for git yet and I've scoured the Internet looking for one. It would be nice though to have the iOS track updated especially for the programming language Swift.
