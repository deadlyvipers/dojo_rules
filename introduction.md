Hello, this is Beau. I am struggling to understand Git and how to use GitHub. I hope the Code School can help me to become a "GitHub Ninja" and master Git and the command line.

My favorite Code School path was, by far, "Git Real." I have been struggling to understand Git and these lessons helped me immensely to get a firmer grasp on Git. That said, I still have a looooooong way to go.
