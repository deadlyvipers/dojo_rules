Introduction
============
Hi! I am a UX/UI Designer who will be moving to Minnesota in a couple of weeks. Trying to wrap my head around git. Yahoo!
Git is my first Code School path, but I think I would like to continue on with the Javascript path! My deadly skills are as follows:
*CSS and LESS
*UX/UI Design
*HTML and Javascript
*Killing history using git rebase
