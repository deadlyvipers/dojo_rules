Nice work! An adventure into the world of pull requests isn't complete without some collaboration. We went ahead and commented on your pull request with one additional requirement.

Check out our comment on your pull request on GitHub and follow the instructions to finish off the Pull Request process. Make the appropriate change locally then add and commit the changes.

With your introduction updated, push it back up to your fork of the "dojo_rules" repository. You won't need to create a new pull request for this new change, and you should see your new commit in the pull request you created earlier. Once that's pushed up, click "Submit Answer".
