Hello, Dojo. My name is Graham and I am the owner of Geronimus Optimals industries.
So far, my favourite CodeSchool path is the JavaScript path, because I am trying to learn how to create a MEAN stack, but the others look good too, and I am particularly enjoying the Git path.

Here are my deadly skills:
*SQL
*C#, VBA and .NET
*JavaScript
*Java
*SAS EG
*ASP.NET
*SharePoint
