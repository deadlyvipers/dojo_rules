My favourite path? Definitely Java Script. I'm learning front end and love programming (HTML & CSS are not so exciting for my brain, and Ruby is beyond my comprehension, maybe I'll learn it later when I get first job;)

Hello dojo and Code School. My name is Bartek Kwapisz. I'm glad that I can learn Git with you. Your tutorials are very good (unfortunately I don't have money for the rest of Git Real). Anyway thanks for those lessons available on Code School :)
