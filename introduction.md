My name is Rok Vuletic. I am from Slovenia and im 23 years old.
Programming is my passion and I find it very interesting.
I am always on a lookout for new things to learn thats why I am also doing this course.
My favorite Code School path is iOS course since I am an iOS developer but I am going to give HTML and CSS a try as well.
