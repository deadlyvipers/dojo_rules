Look! I am just playing with CodeSchool introduction to github course. 

http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/mastering-github/level/1/section/2/forking-and-cloning

my $PATH is `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games`

I don't have Code School path. They charge too much for such tutorials, and I know HTML & CSS pretty well.
