Hello, my name is Adam L Barrett.

I like to use codeschool.com to brush up on my skills. I have learned a lot, even in subjects I was already quite proficient in. I love the interactive style of learning.

My favourite code school path so far is actually the Git path. Git Real, Git Real 2 and so far, Mastering Github
