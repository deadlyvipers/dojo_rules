Hi!  My name is Shaylee Hansen.  I'm taking this course in preparation for the Python/Django Web Development bootcamp that I'm starting at the end of September. 
I've been learning about web development since January. I've enjoyed a lot of the Code School Paths but my favorie on so far has been the Git path :)
