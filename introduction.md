Introducing myself to the Dojo, where my favourite Code School path is Ruby
==========
* I will be always on time for the dojo
* I will be always taking off my shoes
* I will keep the dojo tidy
* I will never bring live blades on the tatami
* I will respect my opponents
* If the Sensei would be respected, depends solely on him!
