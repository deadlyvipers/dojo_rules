Introduction

Code School Path - So far Rails in my favorite!!

Looks good! Could you also please mention your favorite Code School path in your introduction? This could be Ruby, JavaScript, HTML & CSS, iOS or Electives.

On your "deadly_skills" branch, open up your introduction file and modify it to include a list of your deadly skills (for example: Git, JavaScript, Ruby). Since this file is Markdown, you can specify these one per line starting the line with a * to make them into a list.

Add, commit and push your changes up to GitHub. Be sure to push to the remote branch with the same name as your local branch â€“ deadly_skills.
