My favorite CodeSchool track so far is the Javascript Roadtrip. 
My deadly skills include
*Javascript 
*git
*CSS
*HTML
*rebase   I've been playing with code for a while now, but it's quite possible that some of the errors I'm getting could be mitigated with a deeper understanding of accepted best practices.  So, thanks Code School for putting up this course!
