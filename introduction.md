Hi world!

I'm a software developer from Germany.
I really like those codeschool.com git and GitHub courses ;-)

Next I'm planning to take part in the HTML & CSS courses.
The GitReal and GitReal2 courses are really useful as well.

Keep up the good work!

Some deadly skills:
* Git
* Python
* Java
* Javascript
* C/C++
* Killing history using git rebase
etc.
