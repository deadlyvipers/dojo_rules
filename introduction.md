1.4 Introduce Yourself
  Radical course aw ye

  I have only done the Git and regular expression courses so far, but I do like JavaScript as a language quite a bit.  I will probably really enjoy the courses in it.

Deadly Skills:
  * Git
  * JavaScript
  * Java
  * Knitting
  * Eating
  * Killing history using git rebase
