Introduction
============

Hi, _GitHubers_, I'm alquerci.

It's very easy to develop useful applications with git and GitHub.

My favorite Code School path should be HTML & CSS.

I currently playing with PHP, Python and some others and why not follow
the [javascript path][0] for the next one. 

Thank you [CodeSchool][1] to share useful git types.
