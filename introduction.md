git checkout -b deadly_skills
git push origin deadly_skills

I am new to coding but am really enjoying it, I hope to become skilled enough to enter in a career in the field. 
I have only had some experience with c++ and Javascript but so far Javascript is the language I prefer. 

git commit -am "Added deadly skills"
