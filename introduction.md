Hello, my name is Ben, a recent college graduate who would like to master Github, which is why I'm taking this Code School course. 

My favorite Code School path (other than Git) is HTML/CSS, where I'm learning Bootstrap.

Some of my deadly skills include the following:
*HTML
*CSS
*XML
*Linux commands
