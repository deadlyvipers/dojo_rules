Hello Deadly Vipers,

My name is Carla and I live on Maui. I am a student at the University of Hawaii Maui College. 
My professor wants me to learn GIT, so here I am. :)
I am an older student and had zero computer science skills before transferring into the IT degree program from the accounting program.
This is really hard! I am determined to soldier on because I believe these skills are needed in today's workplace.
My favorite code school path so far has been SQL.

Thank you for teaching me!
