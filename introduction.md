# Introduction

This is an almighty introduction to this fork of a repository!
Feel yourself very introduced now, like at home.
:)
I wish everyone a good day out there!

My favorite Code School Path.. lets see. 

Javascript was cool. I had some knowledge gaps there. 
HTML/CSS helped me, too. 
Git is my favorite at the moment. Some time ago I had stopped at the 
first half of it, because I knew all I needed to know and I've stumbled 
my way through. The second half is an eye opener now. With a lot of 
stuff that I asked myself for some time now. Thanks ! And btw. the 
integration with github is amazing!
