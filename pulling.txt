We must practice this shiz
I have manages to pull, then merge. The issue I had was that because I already had this file on my computer the message read: "the following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by a merge: pulling.txt please move or remove them before you can merge. Aborting." I deleted the file and then pulled it down from the origin repo. Perhaps what I should have done was move the file elsewhere so that I could compare and edit the files. I'm also not sure if I should be editing files in the terminal or not. It seems to have a funny effect on the files :s
