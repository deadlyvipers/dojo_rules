Dojo Rules
==========

This repository contains a list of dojo rules for the Deadly Vipers dojo.
All members should read the rules.

Check out the [Deadly Vipers](https://github.com/deadlyvipers) organization, since we're really just building on their work and we don't want them to kill us for plagiarizing.
