Dojo Rules
==========
All members should read the rules
This repository contains a list of dojo rules for the Deadly Vipers dojo

Our "README.md" file on the master branch of our "dojo_rules" repository isn't very helpful. Update "README.md" to mention that "All members should read the rules".

Also include a link back to the deadlyvipers organization which started it all ("https://github.com/deadlyvipers").

Feel free to include any other GitHub Flavored Markdown as well.
