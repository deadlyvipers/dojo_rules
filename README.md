####AntonSkochko - self-developer

Hey, my namy is AntonSkochko. I'm from Ukraine.

I'm working on my self a long time now . Started learning everything about web an IT in august 2015, now i'm a junior front-end developer. Thanks to codeschool i learned a lot, that's why i advise everyone to visit them, and learn.

I've made pull request,  but the task didn't passed in. Dont know why , but i'll figure it out soon.

Still no changes, even though i wrote not just a couple of lines.
