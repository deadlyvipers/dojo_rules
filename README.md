==========

All members should read the rules.

[The organization which started it all]("https://github.com/deadlyvipers")

* Use code in `code` blocks
* Remember to use blockquotes! As a wise man once said,
> block quotes are better -
> we need no quotation marks
> it looks like haiku
* **Please** use emphasis _appropriately_! Overuse of emphasis _will be **ignored!**_
