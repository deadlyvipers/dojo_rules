Dojo Rules
==========

This repository contains a list of dojo rules for the Deadly Vipers dojo.
All members should read the rules!

They should also know that it was the [DeadlyVipers](https://github.com/deadlyvipers) who started it all...

Fun with list formatting:

1. Item one
  1. Sub-item one
  2. Sub-item two
2. Item two
  - with a bullet
  - and another bullet
    - and another one!
