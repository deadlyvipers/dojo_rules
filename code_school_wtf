Halfway through the course and then this:

Incorrect Submission

It appears that your user.email is not configured properly. Follow these steps to correct the issue.

First, set your global user.email config.

dojo\_rules (kill\_list)$ git config --global user.email [your GitHub account email address]

Next, you need to amend the commit so that the author is reset.

dojo\_rules (kill\_list)$ git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit

Finally, push the amended commit to GitHub and try again.

dojo\_rules (kill\_list)$ git push origin kill_list -f
