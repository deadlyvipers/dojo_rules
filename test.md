When you Git push/commit do you have to specify the file name you wish to push/commit or does it take every staged/commited file? And, how does the message appear in the remote repo?

Ok, so it seems if you are committing, then pushing a single file you do not need to specify the filename; and instead can use the -m to just write a message about what has been committed. Next thing to try is to commit and push 2 files at once and see how that effects things.
